## Who am I? 
My name is Mitchell. I'm a junior software engineer from the Netherlands with an interest in systems-programming, writing tools and scripts, and Artificial Intelligence.

In my short career I've accumulated experience with a lot of programming languages. Most notably I use Rust, Go, C# and Python almost daily. These 4 are by far my favourite languages. I've also racked up some experience with C, C++, Java, Haskell, Bash, web-languages like PHP (& Laravel) & Java/Typescript. I do backend exclusively.

I'm a Linux/Unix enthousiast. I've used basically all flavours of Linux distro's (Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, and CentOS), but currently I settled on Manjaro Linux. For on-the-go and school I use a 2021 MacBook Pro. On the slight off chance I need to code on Windows, I use virtualized Windows environmnents. 

I have used dozens of IDE's and editors, but my daily driver remains Vim on Linux and Unix. See my [repo](https://github.com/MitchellWeg/vimrc) for my vimrc. I don't use it on Windows however. I find that the Windows terminal's just aren't suited for it (with a slight exception for Windows Terminal). 9 times out of 10 when I need to code on Windows I need to do C# (or something similair on the .NET platform) anyways, so I use Visual Studio; but with the Vim keybindings of course.

Oh yeah, I also really like to play chess ;) I play at SC Magnus and have a national rating of about 1437. I have a love for languages. As you can see, I'm quite proficient in English (if I do say so myself), I can read and sort of speak German, and am currently learning French.
