### Who am I? 
My name is Mitchell. I'm a junior software engineer from the Netherlands with an interest in systems-programming, writing tools and scripts, and Artificial Intelligence.

In my short career, I've accumulated experience with a lot of programming languages. Most notably, I use Rust, Go, C# and Python almost daily. These 4 are by far my favourite languages. I've also racked up some experience with C, C++, Java, Haskell, Bash, web-languages like PHP (Laravel) and Javascript/Typescript. I do backend exclusively.

I'm a Linux/Unix enthousiast. I've used basically all flavours of Linux distro's (Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, and CentOS), but currently I settled on Manjaro Linux. For on-the-go and school I use a 2021 MacBook Pro. On the slight off chance I need to code on Windows, I use virtualized Windows environmnents. 

Oh yeah, I also really like to play chess ;) I play at SC Magnus and have a national rating of about 1480. You can regularly find me at tournaments across the Netherlands.  

I have a love for languages. As you can see, I'm quite proficient in English (if I do say so myself), I can read and sort of speak German, and I am currently learning Spanish.
